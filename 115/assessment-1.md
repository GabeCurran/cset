Now that you've spent a few weeks working on longer projects, how do you think you'll adapt to working in the professional world?

I'm really excited to join the professional world. I've already learned so much and can see and feel my progression, week to week. I have many ambitions and think that my motivation will carry me, so I am hopeful for success. I've definitely struggled a lot, especially with the longer projects. However, I've been learning coping strategies and health tips for years. These have really come into play, especially what I've been taught recently as well. I think that so long as I can find an organization who is at least understanding of my issues, I'll be very successful in the field. I have a very very long way to go, but I'm always trying to improve. I'm really passionate and am excited to hopefully learn from more people along the way as well.



Imagine you are building your Choose-Your-Own-Adventure project in JavaScript for the browser. The user has clicked a button to select which room to enter, walk through how you would manipulate the page to show the next room's description. Explain the DOM methods you would use and why.

In order to create a responsive button, we first need to assign it an onclick event and create a function with an ID. This button will then trigger the function to activate via the onclick event. With an ID set in the onclick to activate the function, the function will then use window.alert to display a description of the room. We would use onclick because it is a simple way of reacting to the user's input of clicking the button.



Why are different data structures useful? Use the Document Object Model as an example. Would it work as any structure other than a tree?

Different data structures are useful for a variety of reasons. One of the main reasons is just the fact that certain things are to an extent, not possible with the other. Even then, others are just vastly more efficient in specified tasks. I think that the tree structure not only makes the most sense for DOM, but is probably the most efficient and comprehensive as well. You could most likely get similar results with DOM by using an array format. However, this really limits how things need to be structured within elements. The tree structure is so useful because it allows us to very easily select nested objects. Also, it very well aligns up with how HTML is structured in general.
