What do you think will be the most difficult aspect of developing a project in a larger team?

I think the most difficult aspect of developing a project in a larger team will be communication. With large projects, it can become difficult to always communicate who's working on what, when something was finished and what needs done. It will require a great deal of checking up and making sure your branch isn't out of date, and if it is, you need to make those changes each time before you can push your work. Also, you have to make sure that whatever you are working on, isn't going to overlap with whatever someone else is working on. For example, if two people are both working on similar features, it would be best to communicate what will be mergeable and what will not be.



Briefly describe a branch and a remote. Compare the defaults to examples that you created.

A branch is essentially a series of commits that diverge from the main path. A branch isn't too terribly different from the main/master branch in essence, but the way the are used is generally very different. Usually, branches diverge from this main branch and will eventually be merged back into the main branch if deemed desireable. They can practically be ignored otherwise, if the workflow revolves around the main branch. The main branch however, is usually treated with more care and only serious changes are applied to it, after testing and agreement. A remote is basically just something that has your repo, somewhere else. An example of a popular service used for this is GitHub. GitHub allows a user to easily create a repository on their site, which they can use as a remote to push and pull from.



For the collaborative project this week, which git workflow(s) did you employ? Why?

During this week's project we used a Feature Branch workflow. It's a Feature Branch workflow because we created "feature" branches off of our groupmate's main branch. Then, we would make our changes based on whatever issue we had previously stated and push them to our repo and create a pull request for the groupmate. This has the major advantage of easily creating a system that makes it extremely simple for the user to decide whether or not they like this new feature or not. If they want to merge the feature in, it's as easy as a pull request (provided it's mergeable). Otherwise, the pull request can be ignored or closed.
