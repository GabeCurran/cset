This is your last assessment of the semester. Overall, how comfortable would you feel answering questions like these in job interviews? Have they helped more than regular tests or quizzes?

Personally I feel like these assessments have done a great job of forcing me to think of the things I am learning on a much deeper level. It can be a bit tedious to hit the character limit at times, when I feel something can be answered quite shortly. However, it makes me look for a more in-depth way to answer the problem which at times can be a much better solution. I would definitely still be anxious answering questions like this in an interview, however, I'd be significantly less comfortable than I would be now. That's providing it would even be possible for me to answer those types of questions without this experience.



In the readings this week, you learned a sampling of client-side tooling. Choose one tool that you think will be the most beneficial for you. Explain what it does and why that's important.

I imagine that Parcel will by far be the most useful tool for me. It will allow me check my changes in essentially real-time. Also, it will allow me to easily create a development server to show others what I am working on and what I have changed, which is crucial on a development team. It is also a great way to emulate things that otherwise just wouldn't happen, like pulling dependencies and such. Parcel also allows an ability to add your own custom scripts which is amazing. Aliases can save so much time, especially long-term. They can also make it significantly easier to remember a specific command.



Compare the different stages of the Waterfall and Agile methodologies using the Tic-Tac-Toe game as an example.

Essentially how the Waterfall method works is:
You come up with a plan as a team and separate it into main categores, such as figuring out the requirements, coming up with a design, and so on. These steps are sequential and so, in order to complete the next you must finish the previous. In the presence of a time-constraint, this can have horrible effects. If there is not enough time to do testing, for example, the program is likely to fall short on release. If we had done tic-tac-toe with the waterfall process, we could easily have spent too much time on the design phase or one of the many others and not have found game-breaking bugs until it was too late. With the Agile method however, you work on each piece together. You will do a little bit at a time, in everything to prevent these huge release issues.
