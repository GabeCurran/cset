_After completing the first course, how would you rate yourself? Is there anything you want to do differently to start the next course?_

**I'd say that I honestly put in as much effort as I could. There were a lot of stressful days, which is okay but I still pushed forward. In the next course, I'll use the things I've learned so far to help me succeed. Especially, taking more breaks and slowing myself down!**

_The Weresquirrel program showed many uses for JavaScript Objects and Arrays. Using variables and values from this example, explain the difference between the two data structures._

**I would say the main difference between variables and values are that values are immutable and variables can change if they are redefined.**

**For example, the author uses objects to store multiple values which can be called on later.**
**Such as his "JOURNAL" binding which contains all of the string values that were "written in the journal".**

_Now explain why the author chose to use one structure over the other for each example you chose. Follow the same reasoning and explain how you could have used objects and arrays in your adventure game from last week._

**If the author had attempted to use a string value for every single thing, by itself, then each string would have to be called on manually. By creating these values within an object, they can be called on as one unit. This makes searching and sorting a large amount of data significantly easier.**

**There are many potential ways that this new structure could have been used in my previous game, such as puzzles and storing things like weapon characteristics.**
