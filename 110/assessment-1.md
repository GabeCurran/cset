*Why do you think it's important that HTML is an open standard controlled by a specification rather than being owned by one person or company?*

**It's important for HTML to be an open standard because the internet community needs at least a semi-static structure to work-around, otherwise it would be complete chaos.**
**It is especially important for one company or person to not have sole control over such a tool as well, because of the monopoly and tyrannical potential. A business could essentially define the rules of the internet and even control not only who has access to it, but who has to pay for it and how much. This could quickly lead to absolute corruption and wouldn't inspire the same creative freedoms that the internet does today, not even close. An open platform is far more efficient in improving, adapting, evolving and remaining popular with a community because the *community* is what defines it.**

*Describe the difference between an element and a tag. Use examples.*

**The difference between an element and a tag is that one is the collective and the other is used to signify the beginning and end of it. For example, the ```<html>``` *tag* starts an "html" *element*. Whereas the ```</html>``` tag puts an end to the element. The element includes everything, even the in-between. The tag is like a label to say, "*hey, this is what we're doing now.*" or "*okay guys, we're done with that now.*"**

*In the lecture, I used two quotes from Yoda and Noam Chomsky to explain syntax and semantics. Explain these quotes and how they relate to the HTML you write.*

**The idea behind the quotes is that, while a statement isn't written traditionally in syntax, it may still be understood semantically. Vice versa, it could be written perfectly correct in reference to proper syntax however it holds no real meaning semantically.**

**For example,**

**Noam Chomsky was quoted saying, "*Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.*"**
**While it technically follows the traditional rules of English, aside from being nearly incomprehensible, it is not actually incorrect.**

**On the opposite end of the spectrum, Yoda is frequently quoted for his backwards ways of speaking. However, while the way he speaks may not be syntactically correct, we still very much understand it semantically.**

**The bottom line is, we should do our best to follow both semantic and syntax rules because both are crucial.**
